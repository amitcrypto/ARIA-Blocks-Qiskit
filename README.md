# ARIA-Blocks-Qiskit
The ARIA-Blocks-Qiskit contains Qiskit implementations of Squarer, Multiplier, and Diffusion Matrix used in ARIA block cipher in an open source quanutm computing platform Qiskit. The code can be used to draw the circuit and to find the depth of the circuit; and then it can be used to find overall depth of the quantum reversible circuit of ARIA.  

# Installation Instructions
Qiskit supports Python 3.5 or later. We recommend installing Anaconda, a cross-platform Python distribution for scientific computing. Jupyter, included in Anaconda, is recommended for interacting with Qiskit. Next, install the Qiskit package, using the command "pip install qiskit" on Linux or macOS.
